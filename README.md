# Personal Portfolio Website V2

The second iteration of my personal portfolio website built using React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for styling and subtle animations.

Project scaffolding was set up using [create-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite)'s [react-ts template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts). Modified to support prerendering to build for production and server side rendering for local development.
